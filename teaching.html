                    <ul>
                        <li>"Awesome GSI; loved having him for this course because of how supportive he was and effective at teaching class concepts. Would
                            be thrilled to have him again if I took this course again!"</li>
                        <li>"Very accepting of questions, creates such a welcoming environment and teaches very effectively!"</li>
                        <li>"Made discussion very friendly and warm. It was a joy to learn from David's sections."</li>
                        <li>"I only worked with this GSI a few times but the times that I did work with him really stood out to me. He genuinely cares for his
                            students and their learning and wants them to succeed. He is very kind and supportive and is willing to go beyond the call of duty to
                            help his students."</li>
                        <li>"It is really impressive how aware he is about student's needs. When I explain my approach, he almost gets it instantly, and can
                            identify where it might be going wrong. I think he is very good at explaining things very clearly. I appreciate how when he offers a
                            solution, he provides two solutions, one where I could keep using my original approach and he can help me debug and his
                            suggested solution, which would take more work restructuring –– I appreciate that he acknowledges that I might already have put in
                            a lot of work into my original solution."</li>
                        <li>"David was an amazing Lab TA. He was always really energetic and willing to help, and created a really supportive environment to
                            ask questions. It is very clear that David cares about his students, making sure he helped every student out, even if that meant
                            spending time after lab. Really can't express my gratitude toward David for all the work he did and all the times he helped me out,
                            definitely one of the best learning experiences I had at Berkeley."</li>
                        <li>"Understands the materially very thoroughly which was super helpful at the beginning for when I had more questions about specific
                            things and why they were done that way or why something behaves in this way etc. I was amazed at how quickly he could
                            understand my questions and answer them to their full extent (thank you so much!). Super helpful with git problems too, and very
                            reliable. Getting help from David was super efficient, and he really cares about your learning and understanding. Super nice, always
                            tries to help whenever he can. Was very thankful to have him as my TA for this summer course."</li>
